  <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, 
    depending on the size of the input. Efficient algorithms are those that 
    run faster as the size of the input increases, often represented in 
    Big-O notation to express the upper bound of the runtime. Optimizing time 
    complexity is essential for ensuring algorithms perform well even for large inputs.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm needs 
    to execute, relative to the size of the input. The space complexity is often 
    expressed as O(n), which indicates that the memory usage grows linearly with 
    the input size. Minimizing space complexity is important for managing memory 
    resources, especially in environments with limited memory.
